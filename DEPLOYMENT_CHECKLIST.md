# Deployment Checklist

This checklist outlines key considerations and steps for deploying the TSW Smartlog application.

## Code Quality & Best Practices
- [ ] All code adheres to established coding standards (ESLint, Prettier).
- [ ] Type safety is enforced (TypeScript errors resolved).
- [ ] No `any` types are used without justification.
- [ ] Sensitive information (API keys, secrets) are stored in environment variables, not hardcoded.
- [ ] Unused imports, variables, and dead code are removed.
- [ ] Code is well-commented where necessary, especially for complex logic.

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests are written for critical components and functions.
- [ ] Integration tests cover key user flows and API interactions.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully.
- [ ] Test coverage meets defined thresholds (if applicable).
- [ ] End-to-end tests are implemented for core functionalities.

## Feature-Specific Checks
### User Management
- [ ] User creation, editing, and deletion workflows are functional.
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) is correctly implemented and tested.
- [ ] Client user linking to customers is working as expected.
- [ ] User authentication (login/logout) is secure and robust.

### Order Management
- [ ] New order creation process is smooth and validates input correctly.
- [ ] Order details viewing and editing are functional.
- [ ] Order status updates are reflected accurately.
- [ ] Financial columns (cost, price, profit) are correctly calculated and displayed.

### Document Management
- [ ] Document upload and processing (OCR) is working.
- [ ] Document viewing and deletion are functional.
- [ ] Client pack generation is accurate.

### Shipment Tracking
- [ ] Auto-detection of shipping lines/airlines is accurate.
- [ ] Integration with GoComet, SeaRates, Maersk, etc., is functional.
- [ ] Live tracking updates are displayed correctly.
- [ ] Milestone achievement logic (green ticks) is accurate based on dates/times.
- [ ] Manual tracking updates are possible if needed.

### Estimates & Rate Cards
- [ ] Estimate generation and editing are functional.
- [ ] Customer-specific rate cards are applied correctly.
- [ ] API connection for estimates is stable.

### Dashboard & Reporting
- [ ] Dashboard KPIs and charts display accurate, live data.
- [ ] Customer summary reports generate correctly.
- [ ] Audit trail logs relevant actions.

### API Endpoints
- [ ] All API routes are tested and return expected responses.
- [ ] API authentication and authorization are enforced.
- [ ] Error handling for API routes is robust.
- [ ] Webhooks (e.g., for shipping updates) are configured and tested.

## Performance
- [ ] Page load times are optimized (e.g., image optimization, lazy loading).
- [ ] Data fetching is efficient (e.g., server components, caching strategies).
- [ ] Bundle size is minimized.
- [ ] Lighthouse scores are acceptable.

## Security
- [ ] All dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Input validation is performed on both client and server sides.
- [ ] Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection).
- [ ] Environment variables are securely managed.

## Infrastructure & Deployment
- [ ] Vercel project is correctly configured.
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Vercel.
- [ ] Supabase database is configured and accessible.
- [ ] Database migrations are applied successfully.
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are set up.
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are in place.

## Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor application performance and errors.
- [ ] Gather user feedback.
- [ ] Plan for future iterations and improvements.
